We consider the approximation properties of finite element
spaces on quadrilateral meshes.  The finite element spaces are
constructed starting with a given finite dimensional space of functions
on a square reference element, which is then transformed to a space
of functions on each convex quadrilateral element via a bilinear
isomorphism of the square onto the element.  It is known that for affine
isomorphisms, a necessary and sufficient condition for approximation
of order r+1 in L2 and order r in H1 is that the given space of
functions on the reference element contain all polynomial functions
of total degree at most r.  In the case of bilinear isomorphisms, it
is known that the same estimates hold if the function space contains
all polynomial functions of separate degree r.  We show, by means of
a counterexample, that this latter condition is also necessary. As
applications we demonstrate degradation of the convergence order on
quadrilateral meshes as compared to rectangular meshes for serendipity
finite elements and for various mixed and nonconforming finite elements.

We give a new, simple, dimension-independent definition of the
serendipity finite element family.  The shape functions are the
span of all monomials which are linear in at least s-r of the
variables where s is the degree of the monomial or, equivalently,
whose superlinear degree (total degree with respect to variables
entering at least quadratically) is at most r.  The degrees
of freedom are given by moments of degree at most r-2d on each
face of dimension d.  We establish unisolvence and a geometric
decomposition of the space.
