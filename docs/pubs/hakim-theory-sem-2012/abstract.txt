"An overview of discontinuous Galerkin algorithms with applications to (gyro) kinetic simulations of plasmas"

Understanding edge physics in a tokamak remains an outstanding challenge. To make progress, efficient numerical methods are very helpful in handling the difficulties of the edge. In this talk we will report progress from a project with the long-term goal of developing a continuum edge gyrokinetic code. The code will use hybrid discontinuous/continuous Galerkin finite-element methods augmented with reconstruction techniques from finite-volume schemes. The first part of the talk will be a tutorial on discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes to solve the advection equation. The basic ideas of DG schemes, including recasting the equations in weak-form, selecting basis and test function and numerical flux functions will be discussed.

In the second part we will show how a version of these schemes can be applied to solve a class of problems expressible with Poisson brackets and conserve energy exactly even with a diffusive upwind flux.  We will show results from passive advection, nonlinear vortex merger (incompressible 2D hydrodynamics) and drift-wave turbulence in the Hasegawa-Wakatani equations. Results from several 1D Vlasov-Poisson problems will also be presented.
