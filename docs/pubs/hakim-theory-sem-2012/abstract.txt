"An overview of discontinuous Galerkin algorithms with applications to (gyro) kinetic simulations of plasmas"

Understanding edge physics in a tokamak remains an outstanding challenge. To make progress, efficient and accurate numerical methods are required that can handle the complex physics occurring in the edge. In this talk we will report progress from a project with long-term goal to develop a continuum edge gyrokinetic code. The code will use hybrid discontinuous/continuous Galerkin finite-element methods augmented with reconstruction techniques from finite-volume schemes. The first part of the talk will be a tutorial on discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes to solve the advection equation. The basic ideas of DG schemes, including recasting the equations in weak-form, selecting basis and test functions and numerical flux functions will be discussed.

In the second part we will show how these schemes can be applied to solve a class of problems expressible as a Hamiltonian equation coupled to an elliptic field equation. Such systems admit two quadratic invariants, energy and a second quantity, known by various names (e.g., enstrophy or entropy) in different contexts.  With a proper choice of basis functions and numerical flux function both energy and enstrophy are conserved. Even with a choice of a diffusive, but more stable, upwind flux the scheme is shown to conserve energy, in addition to being enstrophy stable. We will show results from passive advection, nonlinear vortex merger (incompressible 2D hydrodynamics) and drift-wave turbulence in the Hasegawa-Wakatani equations. Results from several 1D Vlasov-Poisson problems, including electron plasma oscillations, nonlinear Landau damping and ion acoustic waves will also be presented.
