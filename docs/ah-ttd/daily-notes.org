  - Hooked in ctests into Lucee. Now one can run all the tests with
    one commmand in the top-level build directory, either 'ctest' or
    'make tests'.
  - Finished FieldItr class. This allows the following:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    int lo[2], up[2];
    Lucee::Box<2, int> rgn(lo, up);
    Lucee::Field<2, double> elcFld(rgn, 3);

    Lucee::FieldPtr<2> ptr = eclFld.createPtr();
    elcFld.setPtr(ptr, 5, 5);
    
    ptr[0] = 1.0;
    ptr[1] = 2.0;
    ptr[2] = 3.0;
#+END_EXAMPLE
    I.e, using FieldPtr one can access/modify the elements at a
    location in the field.
  - Finished ConstFieldPtr class. Same semantics as FieldPtr except
    that is allows pointing to constant Field objects.
  - Finished the getSlice() method in Array object. How to slices of
    derived classes work?
