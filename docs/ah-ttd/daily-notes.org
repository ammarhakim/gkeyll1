  - Hooked in ctests into Lucee. Now one can run all the tests with
    one commmand in the top-level build directory, either 'ctest' or
    'make tests'.
  - Finished FieldItr class. This allows the following:

     int lo[2], up[2];
     Lucee::Box<2, int> rgn(lo, up);
     Lucee::Field<2, double> elcFld(rgn, 3);

     Lucee::FieldPtr<2> ptr = eclFld.createPtr();
     elcFld.setPtr(ptr, 5, 5);

     ptr[0] = 1.0;
     ptr[1] = 2.0;
     ptr[2] = 3.0;

    I.e, using FieldPtr one can access/modify the elements at a
    location in the field.
  - Finished ConstFieldPtr class. Same semantics as FieldPtr except
    that is allows pointing to constant Field objects.
