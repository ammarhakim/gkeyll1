This chapter describes implementation details of core Lucee classes.

@section Array indexing and sequencing.
@cindex Array indexing, implementation

In Lucee, in most situations, array data is stored in a single chunk of
contigous memory. Hence, a method of the mapping of the
@math{N}-dimensional index space to a @math{1}-dimensional index space
is needed. This mapping can be performed in several ways. The default
method in Lucee is to perform row-major mapping.
