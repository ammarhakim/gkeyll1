Lucee Development Proposals
===========================

A Lucee Development Proposal (LDEV) is a short document describing
planned development of a new feature in Lucee. Each LDEV should be a
section giving the overview and motivation for the feature and the
proposed development plan. The LDEV need not be long but should have
enough details for someone already familar with Lucee to understand
the feature being proposed.
