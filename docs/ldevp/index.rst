Lucee Development Proposals
===========================

A Lucee Development Proposal (LDEV) is a short document describing
planned development of a new feature in Lucee. Each LDEV should have a
section giving the overview and motivation for the feature and a
section with the proposed implementaion plan. The LDEV need not be
long, most often less than two pages, but should have enough details
for someone already familar with Lucee to understand the feature being
proposed. Needless to say, LDEVs should be written *before* the actual
code is written.
