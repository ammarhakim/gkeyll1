# Gkeyll: Computational Plasma Physics Framework

Gkeyll programs are written in the `Lua <http://www.lua.org>`_
programming language, version 5.2. Most valid Lua programs are also
valid Gkeyll programs. The Lua programming language is
described in the book `Programming in Lua, Second Edition
http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/pil2. You need not buy this
book: the first edition of the book is available for free `here
http://www.lua.org/pil. The first edition is sufficient for almost
all Gkeyll simulations.

In this manual the Gkeyll specific Lua objects and methods are
described. A Gkeyll simulation is created by writing a Lua program that
uses these Gkeyll-specific objects along with standard Lua control
structures and functions. This gives great flexibility as a powerful
general-purpose language is available for creating simulations.
