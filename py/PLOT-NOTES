Options should be of two types: data options and plotting
options. Treat FV data just like a piecewise constant DG data.

Data options
------------

The script should automatically determine 1D/2D data

File(s) to plot
Component to plot (default 0)
DG polynomial order
Type of basis functions
Transforms file (default none)
Transforms variable
List transform variables
Save data as an HDF5 file?

History(s) to plot
Save history data to tex file?
Hdf5 file name (script picks default)

Plotting Options
----------------

The script should automatically determine 1D/2D plots.

Plot title
Xlabel
Ylabel
For 1D (data and history) should one plot semilogx, semilogy, loglog?

Pcolor or contour plot
Axis free?

Don't show plots?
Save plot as PNG file?
PNG file name (script picks default)
